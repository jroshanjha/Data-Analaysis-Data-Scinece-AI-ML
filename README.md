### 📌 Beginner Practice Questions

- Print first and last character of a string

- Access middle element using indexing

- Use negative indexing to print last 2 elements

- Print your name and age

- Take input from user and display it

- Identify data types of given variables

# Explicit Typecasting
Explicit typecasting is performed when the programmer explicitly converts one data type to another using built-in functions. This is also known as type conversion.

###  Common Typecasting Functions
1. int(): Converts a value to an integer.
2. float(): Converts a value to a float.
3. str(): Converts a value to a string.
4. list(): Converts a value to a list.
5. tuple(): Converts a value to a tuple.
6. set(): Converts a value to a set.
7. dict(): Converts a value to a dictionary (from a list of key-value pairs).
8. bool(): Converts a value to a boolean.


### Number System
